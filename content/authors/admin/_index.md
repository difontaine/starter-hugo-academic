I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Dr. Tatiana Rynearson's lab at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography. I am a field-going oceanographer using genetic techniques to study phytoplankton diversity and primary productivity. I am interested in understanding how environmental stressors associated with climate change affect phytoplankton community dynamics and thus, overall ecosystem function. 

I value science communication and believe it is important to connect my scientific research to the broader public sphere to portray the necessity of ocean research during a time of environmental change. I am the current Editor-in-Chief of oceanbites, a blog that translates recent scientific research for the general public. I love writing of all kinds. As a consultant in URI's Graduate Writing Center , I work with fellow graduate students on their writing.
